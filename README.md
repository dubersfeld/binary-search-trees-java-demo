# binary-search-trees-java-demo
Binary Search Tree Java based demonstration on Canvas using AJAX for communication between browser and server

I present here a Java based demonstration of a Binary Search Tree. The BST itself is implemented in Java on server side and a BST instance is attached as argument to the Http session.

The tree depth is limited to 4 to keep the display simple.

The BST implementation closely follows Cormen's textbook except that I always favor the non-recursive implementation over the recursive one.

In addition I created two Junit classes to separately test the Tree class and the DisplayTree subclass used in the actual application.

I chose to make the Tree class generic.
